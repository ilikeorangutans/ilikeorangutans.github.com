            <h1>Hierarchy of Software Quality</h1>
            <p>This is a topic I&rsquo;ve been thinking and reading about for a long time. And then in the past months I&rsquo;ve been challenged to elaborate why I think code given in one way is better than written in a different way. While unpleasant, this has set me on a course to introspect on software quality, what makes it worthwhile to pursue it, and how to communicate it.</p>
<p>Before we go any further, we need to discuss what quality in software even means. There are two fundamental qualities: internal quality and external quality. External quality describes how well the system solves the business need it&rsquo;s been built for. Internal quality is the structurual quality of software. As a software developer I&rsquo;ve always felt strongly about internal quality. Partially because it is a pleasure to work in a well crafted systems and partially because I&rsquo;ve worked on systems that were prime examples of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_ball_of_mud">Ball of Mud</a>. Having seen both sides, I decided I wanted to be as far away from the ball of mud as I could. In short, I decided to implement everything I wrote so it would be of the highest internal quality possible.</p>
<p>However, something always bothered me about this: aside from stifling myself by over engineering solutions, I realized that often systems with poor internal quality were quite successful. And this is when I realized that without external quality internal quality is meaningless. That might come as no surprise to you, but it took me a while to realize this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve often had disagreements with coworkers over this.</p>
<p>But first, we&rsquo;ll need to define what makes quality software. And this turns out to be really hard, because there are many ways of how one could measure software. You could:</p>
<ul>
<li>count number of lines</li>
<li>measure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity">cyclomatic complexity</a></li>
<li>calculate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_package_metrics">afferent and efferent couplings</a></li>
<li>test/line/branch coverage</li>
<li>adherence to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)">SOLID design principles</a></li>
<li>count the <a href="http://www.osnews.com/images/comics/wtfm.jpg">number of WTFs per minute</a> during code review</li>
<li>determine how spaghetti it looks</li>
<li>count the number of bug reports</li>
<li>ask your developers how happy they are working on this piece of software</li>
<li>and many more</li>
</ul>
<p>This non-exhaustive list makes it obvious that there are tons of different qualities that one could measure and while all of them have their use, they don&rsquo;t tell the whole picture.
The need for quality in software</p>
<p>What makes software good?
talk about internal vs external quality</p>
<p>Define: software qualities?
Define: what makes them good?
Explain: why the given hierarchy, i.e. why is one more important than the other? Here we talk about ideals vs delivering value
Explain: how far up in the pyramid do you have to go and how to decide? Size of change/program/etc as criteria</p>
<p>Pyramid/hierarchy of quality criteria</p>

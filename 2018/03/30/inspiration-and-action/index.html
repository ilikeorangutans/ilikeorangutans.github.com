&ndash; Frank Tibolt
I think of myself as a perfectionist, the kind of person that hates to produce anything short of flawless. And while this is great quality to have because it drives me to improve and progress, it&rsquo;s also incredibly crippling and frustrating. I&rsquo;ve often noticed that while I had great ideas, I would often fail to implement them because I would try to over engineer my approach so it would solve everything perfectly. Obviously, many of these ideas and projects never went anywhere. But then on the contrary, ideas where I just started hacking something together often went much further and produced something usable and new."><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="og:url" content="https://ilikeorangutans.github.io/2018/03/30/inspiration-and-action/"><meta name=viewport content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1"><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/output.css><link rel=canonical href=https://ilikeorangutans.github.io/></head><body class="bg-gray-50 text-gray-900"><header class="bg-white shadow-sm border-b"><div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 py-6"><nav class="flex justify-between items-center"><a href=/ class=navbar-brand><h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-teal-900 hover:text-orange-400 transition-colors">Jakob Külzer</h1></a><div class=space-x-6><a href=/ class="text-gray-600 hover:text-orange-400 transition-colors">Home</a>

And while this is great quality to have because it drives me to improve and progress, it&rsquo;s also incredibly crippling and frustrating. I&rsquo;ve often noticed that while I had great ideas, I would often fail to implement them because I would try to over engineer my approach so it would solve everything perfectly. Obviously, many of these ideas and projects never went anywhere. But then on the contrary, ideas where I just started hacking something together often went much further and produced something usable and new.</p><p>Frank Tibolt&rsquo;s quote speaks so much to me because it encapsulates the whole idea so well &ndash; if you just think about this great idea you have, then you&rsquo;re not going to achieve much. But if you start doing things, you&rsquo;ll get somewhere. Maybe not where you want to get to, but you&rsquo;ll have something. And something&rsquo;s better than nothing (or just an idea for that matter).</p><p>And interestingly even if you have no inspiration at all, just going ahead and doing something often leads to inspiration to do other things. If I don&rsquo;t feel like doing anything, for example on a weekend morning, I&rsquo;ll start by doing little things: do the dishes, clean the kitchen, make the bed, etc. And before I know it, I&rsquo;m reading, programming, organizing. Another nice benefit of this is that when Sunday night eventually arrives, I don&rsquo;t feel like I wasted a weekend.</p><p>The underlying idea, that action generates inspiration, is interesting because it shows up in different variations:</p><ul><li>I like to think of the idea of short feedback loops in software development (or Agile, agile?) as a variation or at least an enabler: a short feedback loop enable action. You can do things, and you don&rsquo;t have to think about how to do it perfectly.</li><li>The test driven mantra of <em>test first</em>. Aside of the obvious benefits, writing a test first is an action that gets your mind going. You can do it almost mechanically and you&rsquo;re already started on the bug you&rsquo;re trying to squash or the feature you&rsquo;re trying to add.</li><li>Default to creating, not consuming. If I spend lots of time just consuming media, I might learn new things, but it leaves me <a href=/2017/08/23/on-wasted-time/>unaccomplished because at the end of the day I haven&rsquo;t done much at all</a>.</li></ul><p>Some of these thoughts might be a stretch, I think they hold some truth. I made my bed this morning and already wrote this blog post. So make sure you make your bed.</p></div></div></article><div id=disqus_thread></div><script>window.disqus_config=function(){},function(){if(["localhost","127.0.0.1"].indexOf(window.location.hostname)!=-1){document.getElementById("disqus_thread").innerHTML="Disqus comments not available by default when the website is previewed locally.";return}var t=document,e=t.createElement("script");e.async=!0,e.src="//ilikeorangutans.disqus.com/embed.js",e.setAttribute("data-timestamp",+new Date),(t.head||t.body).appendChild(e)}()</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href=https://disqus.com class=dsq-brlink>comments powered by <span class=logo-disqus>Disqus</span></a></main><footer class="bg-white border-t mt-12"><div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 py-8"><div class="text-center text-gray-600"><p>&copy; 2025 Jakob Külzer.

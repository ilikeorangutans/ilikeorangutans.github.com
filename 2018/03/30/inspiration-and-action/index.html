            <h1>Inspiration and Action</h1>
            <p>I&rsquo;m currently re-reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321503627/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jakkuesblo-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0321503627&amp;linkId=a9bf101a0a7973e0d0d78406aa41dc23">Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests</a>, and this quote really spoke to me:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We should be taught not to wait for inspiration to start a thing. Action always generates inspiration. Inspiration seldom generates action.</p>

<p>&ndash; Frank Tibolt</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think of myself as a perfectionist, the kind of person that hates to produce anything short of flawless. And while this is great quality to have because it drives me to improve and progress, it&rsquo;s also incredibly crippling and frustrating. I&rsquo;ve often noticed that while I had great ideas, I would often fail to implement them because I would try to over engineer my approach so it would solve everything perfectly. Obviously, many of these ideas and projects never went anywhere. But then on the contrary, ideas where I just started hacking something together often went much further and produced something usable and new.</p>

<p>Frank Tibolt&rsquo;s quote speaks so much to me because it encapsulates the whole idea so well &ndash; if you just think about this great idea you have, then you&rsquo;re not going to achieve much. But if you start doing things, you&rsquo;ll get somewhere. Maybe not where you want to get to, but you&rsquo;ll have something. And something&rsquo;s better than nothing (or just an idea for that matter).</p>

<p>And interestingly even if you have no inspiration at all, just going ahead and doing something often leads to inspiration to do other things. If I don&rsquo;t feel like doing anything, for example on a weekend morning, I&rsquo;ll start by doing little things: do the dishes, clean the kitchen, make the bed, etc. And before I know it, I&rsquo;m reading, programming, organizing. Another nice benefit of this is that when Sunday night eventually arrives, I don&rsquo;t feel like I wasted a weekend.</p>

<p>The underlying idea, that action generates inspiration, is interesting because it shows up in different variations:</p>

<ul>
<li>I like to think of the idea of short feedback loops in software development (or Agile, agile?) as a variation or at least an enabler: a short feedback loop enable action. You can do things, and you don&rsquo;t have to think about how to do it perfectly.</li>
<li>The test driven mantra of <em>test first</em>. Aside of the obvious benefits, writing a test first is an action that gets your mind going. You can do it almost mechanically and you&rsquo;re already started on the bug you&rsquo;re trying to squash or the feature you&rsquo;re trying to add.</li>
<li>Default to creating, not consuming. If I spend lots of time just consuming media, I might learn new things, but it leaves me <a href="/2017/08/23/on-wasted-time/">unaccomplished because at the end of the day I haven&rsquo;t done much at all</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of these thoughts might be a stretch, I think they hold some truth. I made my bed this morning and already wrote this blog post. So make sure you make your bed.</p>

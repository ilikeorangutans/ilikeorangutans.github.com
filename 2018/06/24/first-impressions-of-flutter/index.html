            <h1>First Impressions of Flutter</h1>
            <p>Google recently announced <a href="https://medium.com/flutter-io/flutter-release-preview-1-943a9b6ee65a">availability of 1.0 preview
</a> of <a href="https://flutter.io/">Flutter</a>, a new
framework for building mobile apps, written from scratch with performance and beautiful UIs in mind. I&rsquo;ve always been
interested in building apps for mobile devices in general and Android in particular thanks to the number of Android
devices I own, but was always discouraged by the complexity of building Android apps. I have one on the Android store
that got too unwieldy to work on and I eventually had to cease development due to time constraints. Now with flutter
closing in on its first release build I got interested, not only because it is a new beginning to building mobile apps
&ndash; and we all know that developers love newly built things &ndash; but also because it uses
<a href="https://www.dartlang.org/">Dart</a>, Googles attempt to create a language to replace JavaScript that, sadly, went not far.</p>

<p>But lets get into it. This is as much my first impressions of Flutter as it is of Dart. Here are things I took note of
when working through the <a href="https://flutter.io/get-started/codelab/">flutter tutorial</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>It comes with a formatter! To some that might be rather boring but to me its a big deal. If a language comes with a
tool that lets me format files out of the box I&rsquo;m very happy. Well formatted code is easier to read than badly
formatted code and consistently formatted code is better than inconsistent formatting. A formatter solves both these
problems.</li>
<li>Hot reloading of apps makes tweaking UIs a breeze! I remember building Android UIs being excruciatingly slow.</li>
<li>In Flutter even alignments are widgets and not properties of a widget. Interesting.</li>
<li>I like Dart so far. It has fat-arrow functions and it&rsquo;s syntax reminds a bit of Ruby and its blocks. I like how it
lends itself to describing UI structures. I particularly like that it is an OOP language where I can send messages to
ints or booleans.</li>
<li>Dart&rsquo;s <a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/">package repository</a> is nice.</li>
<li>I love how the IntelliJ plugin shows a little preview of icons and colours in the sidebar: <img src="screenshot.png" alt="" /></li>
</ul>

<p>I quite enjoyed building the little list generator app from the tutorial. I like how Dart&rsquo;s code is more concise than
plain Java (seriously, the amount of boiler plate code in Android apps always turned me off) and how quickly I was able
to build a decent looking app within an hour or two. Now I really want to build a mobile app, maybe I should revive my
old app using Flutter?</p>

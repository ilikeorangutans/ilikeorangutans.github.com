framework for building mobile apps, written from scratch with performance and beautiful UIs in mind. I&rsquo;ve always been
interested in building apps for mobile devices in general and Android in particular thanks to the number of Android

<a href=https://www.dartlang.org/>Dart</a>, Googles attempt to create a language to replace JavaScript that, sadly, went not far.</p><p>But lets get into it. This is as much my first impressions of Flutter as it is of Dart. Here are things I took note of
when working through the <a href=https://flutter.io/get-started/codelab/>flutter tutorial</a>:</p><ul><li>It comes with a formatter! To some that might be rather boring but to me its a big deal. If a language comes with a
tool that lets me format files out of the box I&rsquo;m very happy. Well formatted code is easier to read than badly
formatted code and consistently formatted code is better than inconsistent formatting. A formatter solves both these
problems.</li><li>Hot reloading of apps makes tweaking UIs a breeze! I remember building Android UIs being excruciatingly slow.</li><li>In Flutter even alignments are widgets and not properties of a widget. Interesting.</li><li>I like Dart so far. It has fat-arrow functions and it&rsquo;s syntax reminds a bit of Ruby and its blocks. I like how it
lends itself to describing UI structures. I particularly like that it is an OOP language where I can send messages to
ints or booleans.</li><li>Dart&rsquo;s <a href=https://pub.dartlang.org/>package repository</a> is nice.</li><li>I love how the IntelliJ plugin shows a little preview of icons and colours in the sidebar: <img src=screenshot.png alt></li></ul><p>I quite enjoyed building the little list generator app from the tutorial. I like how Dart&rsquo;s code is more concise than
plain Java (seriously, the amount of boiler plate code in Android apps always turned me off) and how quickly I was able
to build a decent looking app within an hour or two. Now I really want to build a mobile app, maybe I should revive my
old app using Flutter?</p></div></div></article><div id=disqus_thread></div><script>window.disqus_config=function(){},function(){if(["localhost","127.0.0.1"].indexOf(window.location.hostname)!=-1){document.getElementById("disqus_thread").innerHTML="Disqus comments not available by default when the website is previewed locally.";return}var t=document,e=t.createElement("script");e.async=!0,e.src="//ilikeorangutans.disqus.com/embed.js",e.setAttribute("data-timestamp",+new Date),(t.head||t.body).appendChild(e)}()</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href=https://disqus.com class=dsq-brlink>comments powered by <span class=logo-disqus>Disqus</span></a></main><footer class="bg-white border-t mt-12"><div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 py-8"><div class="text-center text-gray-600"><p>&copy; 2025 Jakob Külzer.

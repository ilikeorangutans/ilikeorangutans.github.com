Recently I've been reading a lot about software development and philosophies on how to write better software. I really enjoyed the [Rugged Manifesto](https://www.ruggedsoftware.org/) as it emphasizes how software is crucial in our world and the responsibilities that come with it. 
Another great guide is [Twelve-Factor App](http://www.12factor.net/), a list of 12 principles on how to effectively implement and operate applications. 
And last but not least, [Understanding JVM Internals](http://www.cubrid.org/blog/dev-platform/understanding-jvm-internals), a really well written cross cut through the JVM, including class file format, JVM structure and stack memory layouts.

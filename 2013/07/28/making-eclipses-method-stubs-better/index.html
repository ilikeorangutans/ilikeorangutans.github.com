So much that I haven&rsquo;t started Eclipse in weeks. I&rsquo;m still not as fast as I was with Eclipse, but over time I&rsquo;ll get there. And until then, IntelliJ&rsquo;s higher speed (and unfortunately higher RAM consumption), fantastic inspections, Maven support, dark color scheme (yes, I love it), and great refactoring support will make up for it.</p><p>Trying to say, sometimes it&rsquo;s worth to go beyond your comfort zone when it comes to IDEs. It&rsquo;s painful initially, but after a while it pays off.</p></div></div></article><div id=disqus_thread></div><script>window.disqus_config=function(){},function(){if(["localhost","127.0.0.1"].indexOf(window.location.hostname)!=-1){document.getElementById("disqus_thread").innerHTML="Disqus comments not available by default when the website is previewed locally.";return}var t=document,e=t.createElement("script");e.async=!0,e.src="//ilikeorangutans.disqus.com/embed.js",e.setAttribute("data-timestamp",+new Date),(t.head||t.body).appendChild(e)}()</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href=https://disqus.com class=dsq-brlink>comments powered by <span class=logo-disqus>Disqus</span></a></main><footer class="bg-white border-t mt-12"><div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 py-8"><div class="text-center text-gray-600"><p>&copy; 2025 Jakob Külzer.

Most people don&rsquo;t even read the permissions that the apps they&rsquo;re installing on their phones are requesting. It&rsquo;s just another annoying click. Even if people read the list of permissions that apps wanted, what could they do? They can only approve or reject the application. And often enough, the concerns as &ldquo;What does the Facebook app do with my location and call data?&rdquo; are dismissed in favour of whatever pleasantness the app offers. This opens an interesting question: what good are permissions if people will give out whatever permissions an application asks for?</p><p>Every system that has this concept of privileges or permissions will warn its users that they are about to let an application read all their text messages or send location data over the wireless data connection. And just to make sure that your system is secure, it will warn you to only install applications that you <em>trust</em>. But how could you trust an application without installing it? We&rsquo;ve seen malware being distributed by app stores of respectable and <em>trusted</em> companies. So what good is trust if it&rsquo;s given out blindly?</p><p>So instead of giving an app blank access to everything it asks for, why not let the user decide how much of the permissions he wants to grant? Lets say you are about to install a social media network&rsquo;s app on your phone. You don&rsquo;t know the app, you don&rsquo;t trust it, and you certainly don&rsquo;t want it to read all your text messages, your location data, your emails, and dig around your photos. But using the data connection is ok, after all, you want to see what your friends are up to. Suddenly the permissions screen makes a lot more sense. It actually benefits the user to take time and read it, and give or reject permissions.</p><p>I really hope that user controller permissions will become reality soon. It bugs me that with every app, I have to give away control over my data where it seems that most of that data is not required for running an app.</p><p>And now, I&rsquo;ll install Prose…</p></div></div></article><div id=disqus_thread></div><script>window.disqus_config=function(){},function(){if(["localhost","127.0.0.1"].indexOf(window.location.hostname)!=-1){document.getElementById("disqus_thread").innerHTML="Disqus comments not available by default when the website is previewed locally.";return}var t=document,e=t.createElement("script");e.async=!0,e.src="//ilikeorangutans.disqus.com/embed.js",e.setAttribute("data-timestamp",+new Date),(t.head||t.body).appendChild(e)}()</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href=https://disqus.com class=dsq-brlink>comments powered by <span class=logo-disqus>Disqus</span></a></main><footer class="bg-white border-t mt-12"><div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 py-8"><div class="text-center text-gray-600"><p>&copy; 2025 Jakob Külzer.

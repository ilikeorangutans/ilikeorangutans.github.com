            <h1>Zig - First Impressions</h1>
            <p>I&rsquo;ve been following the zig language for a while ever since I saw <a href="https://corecursive.com/067-zig-with-andrew-kelley/">Andrew Kelly&rsquo;s talk</a> on <a href="https://corecursive.com/">Corecursive</a>.
The way Andrew describes the design of zig was very engrossing and who doesn&rsquo;t like a language build
for speed. But I have struggled with picking it up; time is in short supply and so were docs for zig
when I first looked at it.</p>
<p>But that has changed; I finally found some motivation and <a href="https://ziglearn.org/">ziglearn.org</a> which
is a good introduction to zig. I have only managed to read the first two chapters, much less understand
them but it&rsquo;s enough to be dangerous (to myself?).</p>
<h2 id="language">Language</h2>
<p>Observations for Zig 0.11, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>looks and feels like C; requires a lot of parentheses and curly braces, statements end with semicolon.
At times it feels like a much more low-level Go.</li>
<li>imports are done via <code>@import</code> and assigned to <code>const</code> fields: <code>const std = @import(&quot;std&quot;);</code>. Importing sub
packages is done via previously imported packages, I think: <code>const fs = std.fs;</code></li>
<li>I find the <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.11.0/std/#A;std">standard library documentation</a> a bit hard
to parse. It&rsquo;s serviceable but I feel like I get lost often.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s no (real) string type in the standard library or language. Everything is done via <code>[]u8</code>, essentially
byte arrays. Super fast but if you need to handle anything non-ASCII, you&rsquo;ll have to pull in an external
library.</li>
<li>You bring your own allocator. Unlike other languages where the act of requesting memory is hidden away,
you must create your own <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.11.0/std/#A;std:mem.Allocator">allocator</a> and pass it to code that needs to allocate memory. There&rsquo;s several
different kind of allocators available in <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.11.0/std/#A;std:heap"><code>std.heap</code></a>.</li>
<li>zig has structs. They&rsquo;re defined pretty much how you&rsquo;d expect, with the exception that the type is
assigned to a const (this is a theme): <code>const MyStruct = struct { number: u32, name: []const u8 }</code>.
Struct literal on the other hand look a bit different: <code>const my_struct = MyStruct{ .number = 13, .name = &quot;Jakob&quot;};</code>.
Prefixing the field names with a dot keeps throwing me off.</li>
<li>Zig can build really small binaries. <code>zig build --release-safe=true</code> spits out a hello-world binary
that&rsquo;s only a few kilobytes.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s also enums and unions. Enums are what you&rsquo;d expect: <code>const Flavors = enum {Sweet, Savoury};</code>.
Unions look very similar to enums and I haven&rsquo;t fully grokked the difference.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s modules but there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a language level mechanism to define one, unlike
go&rsquo;s <code>package</code>. You simply create a file and <code>@import</code> it.</li>
<li>Functions are defined with the <code>fn</code> keyword. They can be <code>pub</code> which makes them available outside of
module. They must define a return type which can be <code>void</code>. Function parameters are read-only.</li>
<li>Zig has <em>payload capturing</em> which looks a little bit like Ruby&rsquo;s block statements:
<pre tabindex="0"><code>someFunc() catch |err| {
  // handle error
};
</code></pre></li>
<li>Errors are values and can be grouped via Error sets: <code>const MyError = error { StuffWentWrongError, OutOfMemoryError };</code></li>
<li>Any type can be turned into a union with an error with <code>!</code>. For example, <code>MyError!u32</code> means it&rsquo;s either
<code>MyError</code> or <code>u32</code>. From what I can tell, simply prefixing any type with <code>!</code> means it can be any
error. This is a really nice take on error handling.</li>
<li>Complementary to error unions there are the <code>try</code> and <code>catch</code> keywords. <code>try</code> accepts an error union
and if it&rsquo;s an error, returns that. <code>catch</code> can be used to handle errors using payload capturing.</li>
<li>Unused variables and parameters are an error. Annoying at times but good.</li>
<li>You can add methods to structs and enums and presumably unions. You do so by adding the function
definition into the curly braces of the struct/enum definition:
<pre tabindex="0"><code>const MyStruct = struct {
  name: []const u8,
  length: u32,

  pub fn instanceMethod(self: MyStruct) {} // I can be called on instances of the struct

  pub fn method() {} // I can be called on the MyStruct namespace
}
</code></pre></li>
<li>I have only glanced at threads so far but there seems to be a package that bring
<a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.11.0/std/#A;std:event">channels and event loops</a>. I haven&rsquo;t tested
it yet but it looks promising.</li>
<li>Interop with C is supposedly great, but I haven&rsquo;t tried it yet.</li>
<li>Some people use zig just to compile c projects because the zig tool bundles many common header libraries
making builds super easy. Again, haven&rsquo;t tried it yet, but it sure is enticing.</li>
<li>The language has this really fascinating concept of <code>comptime</code> that I haven&rsquo;t even begun
to understand. But it&rsquo;s supposedly very powerful and Zig implements generics through it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ecosystem">Ecosystem</h2>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t know much yet, but the few things I&rsquo;ve picked up so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>zls</code> language server is decent. It integrates well with <code>vim</code>.</li>
<li><a href="https://ziglearn.org/">ziglearn.org</a> is a great resource.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not sure what the state of package managers is. There is a <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/projects/4">project board</a>
but it looks like an official release is still some time away. Until then I&rsquo;m not sure how
I would pull external libraries like <a href="https://github.com/JakubSzark/zig-string">zig-string</a>
into my project. I guess I&rsquo;ll have to vendor it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Zig seems like a fun language. It brings many things I&rsquo;ve come to enjoy in other languages and the syntax is
similar enough to Go that I can mostly just read it (unlike Elm). I&rsquo;ve only scratched the surface but it already
feels much less of a fight than Rust. It&rsquo;s definitely a candidate for the next
Advent of Code and/or for a personal project.</p>

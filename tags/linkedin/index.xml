It&amp;rsquo;s really easy to go in and click &amp;ldquo;Endorse&amp;rdquo; on a bunch of skills. However, one thing that kept surprising me was &lt;em>who&lt;/em> endorsed &lt;em>what&lt;/em> skills. For example, just today I had a ex-coworker from over 4 years ago endorse me for Hibernate. Which by itself is a nice gesture, only thing is, he&amp;rsquo;s an art director. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be pretentious, but I would believe that he knows as much about Hibernate as I know about Photoshop filters or fine arts. As a matter of fact, I usually get yelled at for my choices of colour. If he would have endorsed me for &amp;ldquo;Teamwork&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Attention to Detail&amp;rdquo; or something like that, I would agree that it is an accurate representation of my skills. But getting endorsed for my Java ORM skills by a designer doesn&amp;rsquo;t constitute valuable feedback.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

      <description>I was browsing the Pragmatic Bookshelf and this book caught my eye: writing a ray tracer from ground up with a test driven approach? This sounds like a fantastic challenge to me. I always was interested in ray tracers but always thought it too complicated a topic to do it myself. However, test driven development has helped me work on some complex and terrible code bases, so this feels reassuring to me.</description>

      <description>I recently received my copy of Working Effectivly With Legacy Code and have been busy reading it. The book, as a product of its time, has examples of not only Java, but also C++, probably to show concepts and techniques that apply to languages that behave differently in terms of linking and building. But regardless of its examples not really applying to what I work with, it was full of useful vocabulary and techniques to work with not only legacy systems, but really, any kind of system.</description>

      <title>Inspiration and Action</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently re-reading Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests, and this quote really spoke to me:&#xA;We should be taught not to wait for inspiration to start a thing. Action always generates inspiration. Inspiration seldom generates action.&#xA;&amp;ndash; Frank Tibolt&#xA;I think of myself as a perfectionist, the kind of person that hates to produce anything short of flawless. And while this is great quality to have because it drives me to improve and progress, it&amp;rsquo;s also incredibly crippling and frustrating.</description>

      <description>Note: I&amp;rsquo;m still working on this post, but I already use it as a reference so there&amp;rsquo;ll be more content over time.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve been quite busy at work with updating a Grails 1.3 application to 2.3.4. While writing a test harness it became apparent that lots of things have changed since I&amp;rsquo;ve last worked with Grails. Many changes are for the better, especially the integration of Spock framework. However, there were some issues that took me a while to figure out.</description>

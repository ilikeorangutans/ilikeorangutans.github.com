      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently re-reading Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests, and this quote really spoke to me:
 We should be taught not to wait for inspiration to start a thing. Action always generates inspiration. Inspiration seldom generates action.
&amp;ndash; Frank Tibolt
 I think of myself as a perfectionist, the kind of person that hates to produce anything short of flawless. And while this is great quality to have because it drives me to improve and progress, it&amp;rsquo;s also incredibly crippling and frustrating.</description>

      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling&amp;hellip; unaccomplished. Despite all my achievements, acquired skills, and successes I&amp;rsquo;ve had a thought gnawing at the back of my mind. I realized, after looking at my extensive list of side and toy projects, that none of them are making any progress. In some of them I invested lots of time, others are just ideas, barely sketches. But they all have in common that I grew tired of working on them.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had the idea for this blog post in my mind for a long time. It is based on all my personal experiences and observations over the past years and is in no way scientific. It is my personal opinion, and even though this is how I perceive the world, it might not be true for other people. With that said, let&amp;rsquo;s jump to the core of things.
 A happy developer is a productive developer.</description>

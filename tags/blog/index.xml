&lt;p>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t notice, I recently switched my blog from &lt;a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll&lt;/a> to &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo&lt;/a>. The upgrade path from the really old version of Jekyll to the latest version wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite working as expected, and having to mess around with Gemfiles isn&amp;rsquo;t really something I enjoy. Hugo on the other hand is written in Go and comes as a single, standalone binary. That seemed really appealing and I&amp;rsquo;ve had good experiences when trying to build a little &lt;a href="https://github.com/ilikeorangutans/hugo-photo-scanner">photo gallery builder&lt;/a> with it a while ago before Hugo had actual photo support. Moving the content over from the Jekyll frontmatter to the Hugo frontmatter was done easy enough, I even moved some of the good posts from my really old blog on here. I was almost perfectly happy, exception for the theme. The Temple theme is nice, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite what I wanted. So this weekend I built my own (yeah, you&amp;rsquo;re looking at it).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Horray for Jekyll</title><link>https://ilikeorangutans.github.io/2012/06/22/horray-for-jekyll/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jun 2012 13:59:40 -0400</pubDate><author>jakob.kuelzer@gmail.com (Jakob Külzer)</author><guid>https://ilikeorangutans.github.io/2012/06/22/horray-for-jekyll/</guid><description>&lt;p>So I finally got around to play with Jekyll, a static site generator for websites. I was initially sceptical whether a static site generator would be up for running a blog, but after playing with it for a bit, I&amp;rsquo;m in love with this concept. The ability to write my posts in vim (MacVim that is) and version them with Git makes me very happy. As much as I like Wordpress, it&amp;rsquo;s getting more and more sluggish (on my old server at least) and every time I&amp;rsquo;m logging in to it, I spend half an hour installing updates and patches. And with every upgrade I&amp;rsquo;m worried about the database &amp;ndash; even though, in Wordpress&amp;rsquo; defense, no upgrade ever broke the database. Also, I&amp;rsquo;m particularly impressed with support for syntax highlighting, which is absolutely essential for technical posts. I&amp;rsquo;m still digging through the documentation and learning how to use Jekyll, but I&amp;rsquo;m getting there.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

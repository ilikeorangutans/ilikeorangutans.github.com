      <description>This blog does not have Google Analytics. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any tracking at all. The only thing that might do some tracking are the Disqus conversations at the bottom. I don&amp;rsquo;t know who reads my blog, I don&amp;rsquo;t know where my readers are from, or how they came to be on my site. And I did this intentionally. Reflecting on privacy and how it&amp;rsquo;s generally being eroded made me realize how I hate being tracked across websites.</description>

      <title>A New Theme</title>

      <description>After toying around with the really nice Temple theme I decided there was no better way to spend my afternoon than building my own, new theme for my blog.
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t notice, I recently switched my blog from Jekyll to Hugo. The upgrade path from the really old version of Jekyll to the latest version wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite working as expected, and having to mess around with Gemfiles isn&amp;rsquo;t really something I enjoy.</description>

      <title>Horray for Jekyll</title>

      <description>So I finally got around to play with Jekyll, a static site generator for websites. I was initially sceptical whether a static site generator would be up for running a blog, but after playing with it for a bit, I&amp;rsquo;m in love with this concept. The ability to write my posts in vim (MacVim that is) and version them with Git makes me very happy. As much as I like Wordpress, it&amp;rsquo;s getting more and more sluggish (on my old server at least) and every time I&amp;rsquo;m logging in to it, I spend half an hour installing updates and patches.</description>

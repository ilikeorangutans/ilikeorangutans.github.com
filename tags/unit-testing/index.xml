      <description>Note: I&amp;rsquo;m still working on this post, but I already use it as a reference so there&amp;rsquo;ll be more content over time.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been quite busy at work with updating a Grails 1.3 application to 2.3.4. While writing a test harness it became apparent that lots of things have changed since I&amp;rsquo;ve last worked with Grails. Many changes are for the better, especially the integration of Spock framework. However, there were some issues that took me a while to figure out.</description>

      <description>In my career as a software developer, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to appreciate the principles of Continuous Integration (CI). It forces you to do the hard things early and often and thus helps you reduce risk during development. It forces you to write tests, and be responsible about what you check in. All in all, good qualities and something that every development team should aspire to. Or so I thought. Reality is different, and so far almost every development team I have interacted with is deadly afraid of doing CI.</description>

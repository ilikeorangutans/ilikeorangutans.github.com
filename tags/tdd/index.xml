of &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44919.Working_Effectively_with_Legacy_Code">Working Effectivly With Legacy Code&lt;/a>
and have been busy reading it. The book, as a product of its time, has examples of not only Java, but also C++, probably
to show concepts and techniques that apply to languages that behave differently in terms of linking and building. But
regardless of its examples not really applying to what I work with, it was full of useful vocabulary and techniques to
work with not only legacy systems, but really, any kind of system.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

The way Andrew describes the design of zig was very engrossing and who doesn&amp;rsquo;t like a language build
for speed. But I have struggled with picking it up; time is in short supply and so were docs for zig
when I first looked at it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But that has changed; I finally found some motivation and &lt;a href="https://ziglearn.org/">ziglearn.org&lt;/a> which
is a good introduction to zig. I have only managed to read the first two chapters, much less understand
them but it&amp;rsquo;s enough to be dangerous (to myself?).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>First Impressions of Flutter</title><link>https://ilikeorangutans.github.io/2018/06/24/first-impressions-of-flutter/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jun 2018 16:23:34 -0400</pubDate><author>jakob.kuelzer@gmail.com (Jakob Külzer)</author><guid>https://ilikeorangutans.github.io/2018/06/24/first-impressions-of-flutter/</guid><description>&lt;p>Google recently announced &lt;a href="https://medium.com/flutter-io/flutter-release-preview-1-943a9b6ee65a">availability of 1.0 preview
&lt;/a> of &lt;a href="https://flutter.io/">Flutter&lt;/a>, a new
framework for building mobile apps, written from scratch with performance and beautiful UIs in mind. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been
interested in building apps for mobile devices in general and Android in particular thanks to the number of Android
devices I own, but was always discouraged by the complexity of building Android apps. I have one on the Android store
that got too unwieldy to work on and I eventually had to cease development due to time constraints. Now with flutter
closing in on its first release build I got interested, not only because it is a new beginning to building mobile apps
&amp;ndash; and we all know that developers love newly built things &amp;ndash; but also because it uses
&lt;a href="https://www.dartlang.org/">Dart&lt;/a>, Googles attempt to create a language to replace JavaScript that, sadly, went not far.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>First impressions: Go</title><link>https://ilikeorangutans.github.io/2013/11/12/first-impressions-go/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2013 13:59:40 -0400</pubDate><author>jakob.kuelzer@gmail.com (Jakob Külzer)</author><guid>https://ilikeorangutans.github.io/2013/11/12/first-impressions-go/</guid><description>&lt;p>Ever since Google release &lt;a href="http://www.golang.org/">Go&lt;/a> I&amp;rsquo;ve been curious. Many good things were said and I always read bits and pieces here and there. Last week I decided to dive deeper and write some small things and get to know the language.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far I&amp;rsquo;m really impressed. This is a quick list of things I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The go language is full of nice surprises. I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen everything, but just a few things that really impressed me:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

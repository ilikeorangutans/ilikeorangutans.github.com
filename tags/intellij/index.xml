I liked the openness, the available plugins, and many of its features, including the CTRL-1 hotkey that does everything, and a few other things. However, over time Eclipse got slower and slower, more unstable, and after a while just a pain to use, especially when using more than one screen. I decided to give IntelliJ another try, as I&amp;rsquo;ve done a few times before. And like every time I tried it, I got really frustrated. IntelliJ and Eclipse differ in certain areas, and my inability to use the old shortcuts just made me feel like an infant on stilts. However, after more encouraging tips from Reddit and other research, I installed the &lt;a href="http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/?id=1003">Key Promoter Plugin&lt;/a> which shows an angry popup whenever you use the mouse to do something that has a shortcut. With that, I&amp;rsquo;m learning keyboard shortcuts quite fast&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

The site has been growing organically since 2000 and therefore was a big mess. Several attempts to port the site to a CMS driven system failed largely because those CMS systems are usually to complex for our needs (Typo3) or not flexible enough (Joomla, WordPress). So as I was faced with updates to all the updates including image updates which in turn needed thumbnails to be generated. The same day I stumbled randomly over the &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20/">xsl:result-document&lt;/a> function in XSLT 2.0 which allows you to transform a single XML file into several output files. That sparked an idea with me: why not use that to build a CMS system using XML technologies? I&amp;rsquo;ve toyed around with &lt;a href="http://cocoon.apache.org/">Cocoon&lt;/a> a couple of years ago but that was not what I was looking for. So I looked for other technologies&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

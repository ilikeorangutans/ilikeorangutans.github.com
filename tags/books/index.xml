      <description>I recently received my copy of Working Effectivly With Legacy Code and have been busy reading it. The book, as a product of its time, has examples of not only Java, but also C++, probably to show concepts and techniques that apply to languages that behave differently in terms of linking and building. But regardless of its examples not really applying to what I work with, it was full of useful vocabulary and techniques to work with not only legacy systems, but really, any kind of system.</description>

If Sandi recommends it, it must be good. Excited to dive into this one:  Working Effectivly with Legacy Code by Michael C. Feathers   </description>

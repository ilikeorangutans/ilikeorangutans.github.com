Quickstart The easiest way to run books is by using the docker (arm, arm64, amd64) container I'm hosting on ghcr.io. You'll need a Calibre library at /path/to/your/claibre/library : docker pull ghcr.io/ilikeorangutans/books:latest docker run -p 9090:9090 \\ -v /path/to/your/calibre/library:/library:ro \\ ghcr.io/ilikeorangutans/books:latest Now open localhost:9090 . If you can't see any books check the logs for any errors. Features access your calibre library over the web browse books, filter by title read epubs directly in your browser, download all formats for local consumption dark mode support lightweight frontend written in Elm low server resource footprint, ideal for raspberry pi small docker image: ~23 MiB OPDS support Missing Features and Wishlist Things books doesn't do. It might some day, but right now, it doesn't. books does not has any authentication options. I run it behind a reverse proxy with basic authentication. Customization options, tied to user authentication: reading list, mark as read, etc. Better mobile experience. Right now it kinda works, but it's not great. Better search, ideally full-text search. Reading positions/highlights sync. I use MoonReader and it has support for synching reading positions, would be nice to integrate this. Better OPDS support, e.g. with pagination.","title":"Welcome to books"},{"location":"#welcome-to-books","text":"Welcome to the documentation for books , a lightweight web frontend for calibre book libraries.","title":"Welcome to books"},{"location":"#quickstart","text":"The easiest way to run books is by using the docker (arm, arm64, amd64) container I'm hosting on ghcr.io.

It's good at organizing and keeping my books together, but it requires a computer to access the library. Often I found myself sitting on my phone wishing I could just access my books. After poking around calibre for a while, I realized it's a sqlite database that's easily read, and books was born.
